	<h2>Don't explain<h2>
	<p>Hush now, don't explain<br>
	Just say you'll remain<br>
	I'm glad you're back,<br> don't explain<br><br>
		
	Quiet, don't explain<br>
	What is there to gain<br>
	Skip that lipstick<br>
	Don't explain<br><br>

	You know that I love you<br>
	And what endures<br>
	All my thoughts of you<br>
	For I'm so completely yours</p>
